# Super Mario Bros AI with Reinforcement Learning

This project presents an implementation of a reinforcement learning agent that learns to play the classic game Super Mario Bros. The agent is trained using the PyTorch library, one of the most popular libraries for deep learning.

## Project description

The objective of this project is to create an AI agent capable of learning to play Super Mario Bros autonomously. The agent is trained using reinforcement learning techniques, a subfield of artificial intelligence where an agent learns to make decisions based on rewards and punishments.

The agent interacts with the game environment, taking actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards. Over time, the agent learns the optimal policy, which is the sequence of actions that maximizes the total reward.

## Technologies Used

The project uses the PyTorch library to implement the reinforcement learning algorithm. PyTorch is an open-source deep learning library that provides a flexible and efficient framework for building and training machine learning models.

Additionally, the project uses Gym, an open source library for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. Gym provides a collection of test environments, which we can use to train our agent.

## Expected results

The end result is an AI agent capable of playing Super Mario Bros efficiently. The agent must be able to navigate the game environment, avoid obstacles, defeat enemies and achieve the objective. As the agent is trained longer, we expect to see an improvement in game performance.
